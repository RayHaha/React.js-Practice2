Build a season display application in this practicing

I'm going to build a season display application application in the practice2.
In this application, there is three main challenges:
1. Need to get the users physical position
2. Need to determine the current month
3. Need to change text and styling based on location and month

By the way, we assume that October to March in northern hemisphere is winter, otherwise is summer.
